// International Mobile Subscription Identity
// An IMSI is composed of three parts:
//  1) Mobile Country Code (MCC) consisting of three digits. The MCC is 3 digits long and identifies
//    uniquely the country of domicile of the mobile subscription;
//  2) Mobile Network Code (MNC), 2 or 3 digits for 3GPP network applications. The MNC identifies
//    the home PLMN of the mobile subscription. The length of the MNC depends on the value of the
//    MCC. A mixture of two and three digit MNC codes within a single MCC area is not recommended.
//  3) Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN) identifying the mobile subscription within a
//    PLMN. Normally there are 10 digits, but can be fewer in the case of a 3-digit MNC or if
//    national regulations indicate that the total length of the IMSI should be less than 15 digits.
