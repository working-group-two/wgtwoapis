// WebTerminalProtocol used to initiate and control real time media sessions
// between WebRTC enabled endpoints and WG2 Voice Core. Behind WG2 Core can be
// a mobile terminal, or PBX, or SIP Trunk, or another WebRTC endpoint.

// Endpoint can initiate or answer a new call. It can transfer an ongoing call to itself or to
// a mobile terminal. MSISDN of the mobile terminal where call can be transferred to is bound
// to the authentication token used to reach WebTerminalProtocolGateway. The same MSISDN will
// be used as caller ID on the calls made from the endpoint.
//
// There are two types of endpoints, single call pipes operated through the Pipe() rpc method
// and multiple call pipes operated through the MultiPipe() rpc method. The main difference between
// them is that there could be no more than one active call in the single call pipes scenario. That's
// why the call_id parameter is ignored for this scenario. For the ongoing calls, there could be
// multiple calls going on simultaneously and then the call_id in UUID string representation
// is a mandatory parameter. All the differences between the two pipes are listed below:
//  - Pipe ignores call_id and assumes all offer/answers are for the current call
//  - MultiPipe expects call_id as a UUID string representation
//  - when a new Pipe() is opened, an active calls lookup will be performed and
//    INCALL or IDLE message will be sent over the new Pipe() depending whether there is an existing
//    call or not. This is not done in the MultiPipe() case
//
// Initiating a call from the endpoint
//   Endpoint -> {Offer{sdp, msisdn}, call_id} - endpoint sends to Offer with new uuid as call_id and MSISDN of the
//                                               answering party
//   Endpoint <- {Answer{sdp}, call_id} | {Bye{}, call_id} - core sends sdp answer in Answer or rejects call with Bye
//   Endpoint <-> {Bye{}, call_id} - to end the call Endpoint sends Bye, or receives Bye when peer hangs up
//   Note: Endpoint must be prepared to handle multiple Offers from core and Answer them with SDP answer
//         call_id is ignored in the Pipe() scenario
//
// Receiving an incoming call by the endpoint
//   Endpoint <- {Offer{sdp, msisdn}, call_id} - endpoint receives Offer from core with new call_id, sdp, and caller's MSISDN
//   Endpoint -> {Ringing{}, call_id}    - (optional) endpoint tells core it is alerting the user
//   Endpoint -> {Answer{sdp}, call_id}|{Bye{}, call_id} - endpoint sends sdp answer in Answer or rejects with Bye
//   Endpoint <-> {Bye{}, call_id}       - to end the call Endpoint sends Bye, or receives Bye when peer hangs up
//
// Observing MSISDN status
//   State of MSISDN associated with access token can be monitored over WebTerminalProtocol
//   Endpoint <- {Incall{msisdn}, call_id} - endpoint receives Incall indication when its MSISDN making calls using
//                                           other terminals
//   Endpoint <- {Idle{msisdn}, call_id}   - endpoint receives Idle indication when its MSISDN is not part in the call
//   Note: Incall/Idle indications are given to the endpoint upon connecting to the
//   WebTerminalProtocolGateway or call being established/terminated
//   for the Pipe() scenario. For the MultiPipe() scenario the only possible indicator is INCALL for
//   already established MultiPipe() during a call establishment in another MultiPipe() registration.
//
// Transferring call to the endpoint
//   After receiving Incall indication endpoint can transfer call to self by sending a new Offer to the core
//   Endpoint -> {Offer{sdp}, call_id} - call_id is the id of the ongoing call given by Incall indication
//   Endpoint <- {Answer{sdp}, call_id} | {Bye{}, call_id} - core sends sdp answer in Answer or rejects transfer with Bye
//   Endpoint <-> {Bye{}, call_id}       - to end the call Endpoint sends Bye, or receives Bye when peer hangs up
//
// Transferring call to the mobile terminal
//   When endpoint is active party of the ongoing call it can transfer call to the mobile terminal. For that it
//   sends {Action{ToPhone{}}, call_id} message. Example sequence:
//   Endpoint -> {Offer{sdp, msisdn}, call_id} - endpoint sends to Offer with new uuid as call_id and MSISDN of the
//                                               answering party
//   Endpoint <- {Answer{sdp}, call_id} | {Bye{}, call_id} - core sends sdp answer in Answer or rejects call with Bye
//   Endpoint -> {Action{ToPhone{}}, call_id} - handover endpoint's leg to the mobile terminal
//   Endpoint <- {Incall{}, call_id}     - endpoint's leg is transferred to mobile, call still going on
//   Endpoint <- {Idle{}, call_id}       - call ended
//
// ICE
//   Endpoint may send ICE candidates in the SDP
//
// SDP renegotiation
//   Endpoint must be prepared to receive new Offer{call_id, sdp} with updated SDP from the core after initial
//   Offer/Answer exchange has completed. Offer message is used by the core to update SDP.
