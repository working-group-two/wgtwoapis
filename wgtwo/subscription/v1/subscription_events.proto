// Service to handle events related to a subscription, and where the subscriber

//
// - First Attachment : When the subscriber first attaches to the network.
// - Periodic Country : While the subscriber is in a country.
// - Country Change   : When the subscriber changes current country location.
// - Handset Change   : When the SIM card is moved from one handset to another.

  // are different. Note that subscribers being close to borders, or during travels may generate
  // a lot of CountryChange events. See 'PeriodicCountry' events for an alternative.

  // & handset in a specific country, and for each tenant will be triggered on a
  // regular interval. E.g. if 'Operator X' is configured for a 2 week interval,
  // there will be an event every 14 days (or 336 hours or 1209600 seconds) as long
  // as the subscriber is still seen in that country.
  //
  // As this event is not always triggered based on the subscriber moving between
  // countries, it does not contain the previously seen country. For getting the real-time
  // movement of the subscriber between countries, use 'CountryChange' event.
  //
  // This event is triggered:
  //
  // - When the subscriber first turns on the device and it connects to a network, it
  //   will be triggered for the country of the connected network at the same time as the
  //   corresponding 'FirstAttachment' event.
  // - When the subscriber enters a new country (not visited before). This is triggered
  //   at the same time as the corresponding 'CountryChange' event.
  // - When the subscriber is seen in a country, and the 'PeriodicCountry' event for that
  //   subscriber and country has not been triggered for the configured time delay.
  //
  // For subscribers with multiple SIM cards you will see an event for each SIM
  // (IMSI), as they can move between countries individually.
